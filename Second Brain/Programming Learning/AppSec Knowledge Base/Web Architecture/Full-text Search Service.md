- Many if not most web apps support some sort of search feature where a user provides a text input (often called a “query”) and the app returns the most “relevant” results. The technology powering this functionality is typically referred to as “[full-text search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-text_search)”, which leverages an [inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) to quickly look up documents that contain the query keywords.
