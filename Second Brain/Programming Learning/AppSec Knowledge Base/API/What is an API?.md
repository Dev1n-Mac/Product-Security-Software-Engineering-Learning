- An **API**, which stands for **application programming interface**, is a set of protocols that enable different software components to communicate and transfer data. Developers use APIs to bridge the gaps between small, discrete chunks of code in order to create applications that are powerful, resilient, secure, and able to meet user needs. Even though you can't see them, APIs are everywhereâ€”working continuously in the background to power the digital experiences that are essential to our modern lives.

#### How do APIs work?

- APIs work by sharing data between applications, systems, and devices. This happens through a request and response cycle. A user initiates a request for data by interacting with an application. The request is sent to the API, which retrieves the data and returns it to the user.
