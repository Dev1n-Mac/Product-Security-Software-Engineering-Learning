The **`type()`** function returns the data type of the argument passed to it. When the argument is an instance of a [class](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/classes), it returns the class that it is an instance of.


## Syntax

```
type(some_object)
```

The `type()` function primarily accepts `some_object` as a parameter, which can be any of Pythonâ€™s [data types](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/data-types).

## Example

```
The `type()` function can be used to confirm the data type of the object `spam`:
spam = 10
print(type(spam))
```
