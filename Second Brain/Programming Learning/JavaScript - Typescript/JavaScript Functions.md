# JavaScript Function Syntax

- A JavaScript function is defined with the `function` keyword, followed by a **name**, followed by parentheses **()**.

- Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

- The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:  
**(_parameter1, parameter2, ..._)**

- The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: **{}**
